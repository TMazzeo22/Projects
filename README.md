Hi All,

This is my first foray into getting my own data, cleaning it, and creating a story from it.

I have been playing a lot of NieR Autamata lately (PS4) and have been loving the game. I was particularly interested with the different weapons, and wanted
to see if the different weapons could be grouped by particular attributes (I assumed they could but wanted to see what the data shwowed). I also wanted to 
get a sense of scale. Did some weapons have much weaker attributes in the beginning of the game compard to the end? How did they scale with progression?

All of this data is scraped from the NieR Autamata wiki. I mainly used pandas html decoding instead of getting the table information from hand.

This git has 3 main files. 

1. The python script to scrape data from the wiki. (Scrape_Nier_Data)
2. The csv_data output. (Weapon_Data)
3. The Jupyter notebook containing the organizing and data cleaning. (Nier_Cleaning_Visualization)

This will be developing as I have time to work on it outside of work (seldom these days...)

As always more to come!
